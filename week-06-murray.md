I believe Murray's predictions were correct, she talks about how we shouldn't be afraid of new technology and that we should embrace it, but still be in control of it, and I do believe that.
If we let technology take over us, Black Mirror will depict non-fiction instead of fantasy. I know Murray is a fan of Star Trek because, of the title, "Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace."
In Star Trek, the holodeck is a "universal fantasy machine." So it can take someone to their fantasy world, and I believe we have that with Virtual Reality. 
I believe Murray's prediction with the Mandalorian actors is easy to identify, the actors live in a fantasy world every day when they put the costumes on. When they get on set, 
they don't see a green screen behind them, instead a giant screen of the background. I think the layers of reality are more different from the viewers to the actors, from the actors perspective, 
they see the cameramen, and know they are in Hollywood, doing this for a check. They can look around and see regular people drinking coffee in the background, whilst the setting is in the future. 
For the viewers, they do not see behind the scenes, they only see the scenes. They don't hear when the director yells "Cut!" The story is ongoing, there is no breaks in between, only when the season ends. 
In a way though, I do think the actors get involved in the virtual reality aspect too, they have to act and interact with the background and objects near by, they probably knows how the background and digital backgrounds work.
Their job is to act, so of course they're going to be involved. I do think Murray predictions did become a reality, because, she did predict the major impact technology will have on the future, 
how virtual reality is a thing, and there being new technology coming out, for us to embrace it. I mean ten years ago, I would've never heard of AI, but now I see it everywhere.
